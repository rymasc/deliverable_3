Build a device that quantifies energy harvesting rates for solar, vibration, rf, and thermal energies.
It will determine the amount harvested as well as if it will support applications.
We will write two applications and determine their energy use with static code analysis.
Type of Applications
1) sensor -> fram
2) sensor -> radio
3) sensor -> higher freq radio *optional
