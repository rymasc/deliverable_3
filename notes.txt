Idea

Build a device that quantifies energy harvesting rates for solar, vibration, rf, and thermal energies.
It will determine the amount harvested as well as if it will support applications.
We will write two applications and determine their energy use with static code analysis.

Midterm Goals

Two things to do Harvesting Measurement & Usage:

HM

-Get Harvesting devices
-Build the boards
-Verify they work
-Measure a fews

U
-Get Sensors
-Build apps
-Verify power usage

Final Finish the main idea

FW:
effects of multiple energy harvesters at once

Type of Applications
1) sensor -> fram
2) sensor -> radio
3) sensor -> higher freq radio *optional
